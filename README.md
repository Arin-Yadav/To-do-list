# Task 2: To-Do List Web App

A simple, responsive To-Do List application built using **Vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. This project demonstrates dynamic DOM manipulation and event handling to create an interactive task manager — no frameworks, no libraries, just pure front-end logic.

# Objective

Build a functional To-Do List where users can:
- ➕ Add new tasks
- ✅ Mark tasks as complete
- ❌ Remove tasks from the list

All interactions are handled client-side, with tasks stored in memory (no backend or database).

# Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arin-Yadav/To-do-list.git
